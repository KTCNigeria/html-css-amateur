# Task - CSS Positioning

In this task, we'll explore CSS positioning to layout elements on a web page. Just like forms are essential for user input, positioning helps structure the visual layout of a web page.

## Positioning Basics

CSS positioning allows you to control the placement of HTML elements. There are several properties to achieve this, including:
- position: static: The default positioning.
- position: relative: Allows you to position elements relative to their normal position.
- position: absolute: Positions elements relative to their nearest positioned ancestor.
- position: fixed: Elements are positioned relative to the viewport.
- position: sticky: Acts like relative until it reaches a specified offset, then becomes fixed.ktc

## Your Task

Imagine you want to create a simple webpage layout:

- Create a container div element to hold your content.
- Inside the container, add two div elements.
  - One should have some text content and be positioned at the top-left.
  - The other should have a different background color, some text content, and be positioned at the bottom-right.
- Use CSS positioning to achieve these layouts.
